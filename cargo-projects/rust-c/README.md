# Rust in C


### Project notes

- In order to statically link our Rust library, we need to tell `rustc` to emit a static library. This is done by setting a flag in `Cargo.toml` - `crate-type = ["staticlib"]`.
- `#[no_mangle]` - disable symbol mangling which will enables native code linkers to interpret Rust code correctly.
- `#[repr(C)]` - guarantee C layout and ABI

### Files/modules definitions

- `rust-code/src/wrapper.rs` - a wrapper code from which a C header file gets generated
- `rust-code/src/lib.rs` - Rust code that implements a "Person" and some simple functionality
- `rust-code/include/bindings.h` - C headers generated from the Rust code (this gets generated by cbindgen)
