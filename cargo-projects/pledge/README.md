# Simple memory allocator

## Memory Layout & Alignment

### Alignment

This is to describe where the bytes for a type will be stored. It is the arrangement of data in memory. Alignment comes into play when the objects that need to be aligned are larger than the smallest addressable unit. Certain types can only live at certain memory locations for the compiler to generate good, efficient code. It is the way data is arranged 

### Memory Layout

This is how a compiler decides to organise and store a type in a program's memory.
