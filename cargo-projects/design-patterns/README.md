## Behavioural

- Visitor

Visitor is a design pattern that allows adding new behavior to existing class hierarchy without altering any existing code. If there is an algorithm that is required to be applied to heterogeneous data, this pattern is very useful. Visitor object enables visitor to be stateful and communicate info between nodes.

This pattern enables to separate algorithms from objects on which they operate.
